## Problem Description

In universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at position[i], Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.

Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.

Example:

```
Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
Output: 999999999
Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
```

Constraints:

- n == position.length
- 2 <= n <= 10^5
- 1 <= position[i] <= 10^9
- All integers in position are distinct.
- 2 <= m <= position.length

## Code

```
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] position, int m) {
        Arrays.sort(position);
        int left=1;
        int right=position[position.length-1];
        while(left<right){
            int mid=left+(right-left)/2;
            if(isPossible(mid,position,m)){
                left=mid+1;
            }
            else right=mid;
        }
        return left-1;
    }
    private boolean isPossible(int mid,int[] position,int m){
        int ball=m-1;
        int cur=position[0];
        for(int i=1;i<position.length;i++){
            if(position[i]-cur>=mid){
                ball--;
                cur=position[i];
            }
        }
        return ball<=0;
    }
}
```
