https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/

## Problem Description

Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example:

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

## Key
searching for maximal k satisfying k\*k <=x

equals for minimal k satisfying k\*k >x, and return k-1;

## Code

```
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x==1)return 1;
        int left=1;
        int right=x;
        while(left<right){
            int mid=left+(right-left)/2;
            if((long)mid*mid>x){
                right=mid;
            }
            else left=mid+1;
        }
        return left-1;
    }
}
```
