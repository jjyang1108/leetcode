## Problem Description

Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive integers which are divisible by a or b or c.

Example1:

```
Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4.
```

Example2:

```
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4th is 6.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n, a, b, c <= 10^9
- 1 <= a*b*c <= 10^18
- It's guaranteed that the result will be in range [1, 2 * 10^9]

## Key

- target:determine whether there are at least n ugly numbers less than or equal to num
- boundary: 1 - 2*10^9
- convert int to long
- use greatest common division to avoid counting duplicate numbers

## Code

```
class Solution {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
        long left=1;
        long right=(long)(2*Math.pow(10,9));
        while(left<right){
            long mid=(long)(left+(right-left)/2);
            if(condition(mid,n,a,b,c)){
                right=mid;
            }
            else left=mid+1;
        }
        return (int)left;
    }
    private boolean condition(long mid,long n,long a,long b,long c){
        long ab=a*b/gcd(a,b);
        long bc=b*c/gcd(b,c);
        long ac=a*c/gcd(a,c);
        long abc=a*bc/gcd(a,bc);
        long total=mid/a+mid/b+mid/c-mid/ab-mid/bc-mid/ac+mid/abc;
        return total>=n;
    }
    private long gcd(long a,long b){
        long r=0;
        while(b>0){
            r=a%b;
            a=b;
            b=r;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```
