## Problem Description

Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table. But could you find out the k-th smallest number quickly from the multiplication table?

Given the height m and the length n of a m \* n Multiplication Table, and a positive integer k, you need to return the k-th smallest number in this table.

Example1:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output:
Explanation:
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6
3	6	9

The 5-th smallest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
```

Note:

- The m and n will be in the range [1, 30000].
- The k will be in the range [1, m * n]

## Key

- Boundary: 1 - m*n
- condition: whether the number of vals in table which are less than or equal to mid is larger than k.
- target: looking for the minimal val satisfying that there are more than k numbers in table less than or equal to val.

## Code

```
class Solution {
    public int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
        int left=1;
        int right=m*n;
        while(left<right){
            int mid=left+(right-left)/2;
            if(isPossible(mid,m,n,k)){
                right=mid;
            }
            else{
                left=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    private boolean isPossible(int mid, int m, int n,int k){
        int count=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=m;i++){
            int add=Math.min(mid/i,n);
            if(add==0)
                break;
            count+=add;
        }
        return count>=k;
    }
}
```
