Differences between Recursion 递归 and Iteration 迭代:
1. A conditional statement decides the termination of recursion while a control variable’s value decide the termination of the iteration statement (except in the case of a while loop).
2. Infinite recursion can lead to system crash whereas, infinite iteration consumes CPU cycles.
3. Recursion is to repeatedly call the function itself to realize the loop.
4. There must be iteration in recursion, but there is not necessarily recursion in iteration
5. Recursion repeatedly invokes the mechanism, and consequently the overhead, of method calls. This can be expensive in both processor time and memory space while iteration doesn’t.

Code expamle:
Recursion:
public  int fibo(int n){
    if (n != 1 && n != 2){
        result = fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2);
        return result;
    }
    else
        return 1;	
}

Iteration:
int v=1;
for(i=2;i<=100;i++)
{
    v=v+i;
}
