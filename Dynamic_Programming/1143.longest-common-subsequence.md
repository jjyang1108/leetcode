## Problem Description

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Example1:

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

Example2:

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

Constraints:

1 <= text1.length <= 1000
1 <= text2.length <= 1000
The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

## Algorithm

- Dynamic-programming

## Code

```
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int[][] grid=new int[text1.length()+1][text2.length()+1];
        for(int i=text1.length()-1;i>=0;i--){
            for(int j=text2.length()-1;j>=0;j--){
                if(text1.charAt(i)==text2.charAt(j)){
                    grid[i][j]=grid[i+1][j+1]+1;
                }
                else {
                    grid[i][j]=Math.max(grid[i+1][j],grid[i][j+1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return grid[0][0];
    }
}
```
